*****WOPRS_quicklooks_user_manual*****

WOPRS_quicklooks displays images from files generated by WOPRS. Ingests DIMG and corresponding PROC file, and outputs a pdf containing images.

1) Open woprs_quicklook.pro and woprs_quicklook_getsetup.pro in IDL

2) Set the variables DIMG_file and PROC_file equal to the names of the DIMG and PROC files from the flight of interest.
Ex: DIMG_file = '/kingair_data/hcpi20/OAP_processed/20200811/DIMG.200811193926.2DS.cdf'
    PROC_file = '/kingair_data/hcpi20/OAP_processed/20200811/PROC.200811193926.2DS.cdf'

3) Enter the date in yyyymmdd format, and the start and end time for producing images in seconds from the start of the day. Make sure that the end time is later than the start time!
Ex: DATE = 20200811
    Start_time_sec = 72015
    End_time_sec = 72022

4) Edit the outfile path to whatever directory you want the images saved to. The images will be saved to the directory provided, in a folder with the name of the probetype. Make sure to create a folder in the provided directory that is named after the probetype generating the images.
Ex: Output_file_path = '/home/username'
    Generated file if the probetype is HVPS = '/home/username/HVPS/filename'

5) Set any desired Display filters to 'off'. If any filters are set to off, then only images fitting the criteria set below the Display filter are included in the images produced. 
Ex: Display_rejected_particles = 'off'
    good_artifacts = [4,5,6]
    Display_all_diams = 'off'
    minD = 100
    maxD = 15000
    Display_interarrival_rejected = 'on'
    Display_all_in_statuses = 'on'
    good_in_status = [65]
    Etc...
Results in:
    Only images with artifact statuses equal to 4,5, or 6 are included. Only images with diameters between 100 and 15000 micrometers are     included. Images are included regardless of interarrival reject status. Images are included regardless of in status. Etc...

6) Run woprs_quicklook.pro
